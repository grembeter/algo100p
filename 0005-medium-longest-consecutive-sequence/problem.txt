Given N elements, write a program that prints the length of the
longest increasing subsequence.

Examples:

Input: nums = [3, 10, 3, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12]
Output: 6
Explanation:

3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is the longest increasing subsequence.

Input: nums = [6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation:

6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is the longest increasing subsequence.
