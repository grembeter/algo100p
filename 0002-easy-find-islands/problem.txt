Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s
forms an island.

Note: Connections need to be top-down or left-right. Diagonals 1's don't count
as land connections.

For example, the below matrix contains 6 islands:

Input : mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
                   {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
                   {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
                   {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                   {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}}
Output : 6
